This library provides the Flash API build on top of open web standards (HTML5). Developers who build applications with Flash may have noticed that Flash isn't a popular choice for web development anymore. Some of you probably think about a migration strategy from Flash to HTML5.

What we try to achieve with dartflash:

* The library should be highly compatible with the Flash API.
* The programming language should be similar to ActionScript 3.

## Demo

This little game was developed with Flash and later ported to HTML5 in only 6 hours. The new HTML5 version runs with smooth 60fps and does not require the Flash plugin anymore!

## Remarks

_As the Dart language is evolving very quickly, please be sure to use the latest version of the Dart Editor. We recommend that you use the latest supported version of Dart Editor and not one of the continuous builds._
