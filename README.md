The dartflash library is intended for Flash developers who want to migrate their projects as well as their skills to HTML5. Therefore the library provides the familiar Flash API built on open web standards. For an easy transition the library fulfills the following requirements:

* The library is highly compatible with the Flash API.
* The programming language is similar to ActionScript 3.

To meet those requirements the library is built with Googles new programming language called Dart. Dart is a class-based, single inheritance, object-oriented language and compiles to efficient JavaScript.

## Demo

This little game was developed with Flash and later ported to HTML5 in only 6 hours. The new HTML5 version runs with smooth 60fps and does not require the Flash plugin anymore!

The dartflash website contains more demos and documentation. If you are not familiar with the Dart programming language, please take a look at the ActionScript-Dart comparison.

## Remarks

_As the Dart language is evolving very quickly, please be sure to use the latest version of the Dart Editor. We recommend that you use the latest supported version of Dart Editor and not one of the continuous builds._
