This library provides the Flash API build on open web standards (HTML5). Developers who build applications with Flash may have noticed that Flash isn't a popular choice anymore. Some of you probably think about a migration strategy from Flash to HTML5. 

What we try to achieve with dartflash:
* The library should be compatible with the Flash API.
* The programming language should be similar to ActionScript 3.

## Samples

Escape: This little game was developed with Flash and ported to HTML5 within 6 hours. The new version runs with smooth 60 fps!

## Roadmap

dartflash is in an early stage of development but new features will be added over the next days and weeks:

  * Support for WebGL.
  * Additional BitmapFilters like DropShadowFilter
  * A Particle class for cool effects like fire and smoke.
  * TouchEvents for touch screen input.
  * A Video class.
  * Bugfixes.
  * Documentation.

## Remarks

_As the Dart language is evolving very quickly, please be sure to use the latest version of the Dart Editor. We recommend that you use the latest supported version of Dart Editor and not one of the continuous builds._
